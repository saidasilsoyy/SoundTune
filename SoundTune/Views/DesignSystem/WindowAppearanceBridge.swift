///
/// Why a bridge: `.preferredColorScheme(...)` only changes SwiftUI's color
/// resolution. The underlying NSWindow / NSPanel keeps its own NSAppearance,
/// which is what governs `NSVisualEffectView` material rendering. Without this
/// bridge, applying `.preferredColorScheme(.light)` would change SwiftUI Colors
/// but leave a `.regularMaterial` background rendering as dark glass.

/// it on `viewDidMoveToWindow`. This catches the case where the initial
/// `updateNSView` runs before SwiftUI has parented the hosting view into a
/// window — when the window finally arrives, we still apply the correct value.
///
/// When `desiredAppearance` is `nil` (System mode) we apply `NSApp.effectiveAppearance`
/// instead of `nil`. Setting `NSWindow.appearance = nil` leaves persistent windows
/// resolving `NSColor` against the previously-locked appearance until something
/// kicks the window (key/main change, certain redraws), which produces a stale
/// "labels look faded" frame after Light→System until refocus. KVO on
/// `NSApp.effectiveAppearance` re-mirrors the live system value while we're in
/// System mode so the window's appearance is always concrete.
